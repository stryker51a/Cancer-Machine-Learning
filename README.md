# Cancer-Machine-Learning

This Project is based on a Project in the "Coding The Matrix: Linear Algebra Through Computer Science Applications" book, which is where the data came from.
The project was expanded upon by using a neral network in addition to traditional machine learning techniques and comparing the two. In order to do this, the data
was maunally normaized.
